# Preproposal

## What idea(s) do you have for your final project?

## ***Untitled Game A***:

The genre would be a mix of **Rouge-like**: I have recently been playing these types of games some examples: Risk of Rain, Wizard With A Gun, Slay the Spire, PlateUp! and Tower Defence: Plants Vs Zombies and the Bloons TD series are a great example of what type of TD game I'm looking forward to making. The upgrading part of the towers will be the one that would be in the rouge-like style...**NOTE: now that I think about it the towers themselves could be that way too...**. I have played TD games for a while too and wanted to try and make something with a bit of both of my favorite types of games

I want to learn how to use Godot Engine as I do this project, and would also like to learn their GDScript language

### Keeping up with all the goals on Notion, some of the notes/plans I have written down on notion:

# Game Idea

The game will be a Tower Defense and Roguelike game where the player will have to defend their base from waves of enemies. The player will have a variety of towers to choose from, each with unique abilities and upgrades that they chose from 3 or 4 “cards” that pop up after every level up. The enemies will be procedurally generated and will increase in difficulty as the player progresses.

## Game Mechanics

- **Procedural Generation:** Each level of the map will be procedurally generated, ensuring the player never encounters the same layout twice.
- **Semi-Permadeath:** If the player character dies, the game is over, and the player must start a new run from the beginning but keep some type of prestige points to help upgrade their towers and get further in the game.
- **Tower:** The player will play as a Tower, at the center of the map, which ”enemies” will work their way towards and start dealing damage to the tower’s health
- **Inventory System:** The player will be able to collect various artifacts/items found throughout the map which will add/multiply/buff or subtract/divide/nerf the enemy's stats (health, speed, health regeneration, and attack).
- **Enemies:** The Art/Theme for my game is TBD but until then I can use a circle as the Tower and different sizes and colors of squares for the enemies to simulate the game with its “skin” on.
