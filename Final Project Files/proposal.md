# Proposal

## What will (likely) be the title of your project?

Project Tower

## In just a sentence or two, summarize your project. (E.g., "A website that lets you buy and sell stocks.")

A Tower Defence game with a little bit of rougelike

## In a paragraph or more, detail your project. What will your software do? What features will it have? How will it be executed?

I will use Godot Engine as I learn about it and GDScript, it will be a Tower Defense game where the player will have to defend their base from waves of enemies. The player will have a tower at the center which they have to defend through waves, they can buy upgrades each with unique abilities and upgrades. The enemies will be procedurally generated and will increase in difficulty as the player progresses.

## If planning to combine 1051's final project with another course's final project, with which other course? And which aspect(s) of your proposed project would relate to 1051, and which aspect(s) would relate to the other course?

TODO, if applicable

## If planning to collaborate with 1 or 2 classmates for the final project, list their names, email addresses, and the names of their assigned TAs below.

TODO, if applicable

## In the world of software, most everything takes longer to implement than you expect. And so it's not uncommon to accomplish less in a fixed amount of time than you hope.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a GOOD outcome for your final project. I.e., what WILL you accomplish no matter what?

A working main menu
The Tower shoots the enemy
Reward Coins for killing the enemies
Enemies reach the end and decrease the tower's health
(and hopefully)
Add damage, health, and attack speed upgrades

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BETTER outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you THINK you can accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Add damage, health, and attack speed upgrades and some sort of UI for it even if its just a box with text inside it.

### In a sentence (or list of features), define a BEST outcome for your final project. I.e., what do you HOPE to accomplish before the final project's deadline?

Make art for the Background, towers, enemies, and add some sort of SFX and music

## In a paragraph or more, outline your next steps. What new skills will you need to acquire? What topics will you need to research? If working with one of two classmates, who will do what?

I will have to learn the language GDScript, even though it is similar to Python it has many different syntax and I will also need to learn to navigate the Godot engine application
