Short answers for the below questions suffice. If you want to alter your plan for your project (and obtain approval for the same), be sure to email your section leader directly!

#### What have you done for your project so far?

Made a design for the tower and enemies

#### What have you not done for your project yet?

I now need to make a map, main menu and make the tower and enemies interact with each other such as the enemies spawning and dealing damage when they reach the end, the tower automatically shooting the closest enemy until it is destroyed. Add upgrades to the tower from the coins earned by destroying the enemies.

#### What problems, if any, have you encountered?

Not knowing the language and the engine I am using has caused a few problems, mainly not knowing how nodes interact with each other and what signals they send and how to use them in my code. And also the the fact that Godot engine 4 was recently released and there aren't many youtube videos with examples of it being used in action.
